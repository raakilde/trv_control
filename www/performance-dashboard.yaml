      ## TRV Control Performance Guide

      **Efficiency Score**: Overall performance rating (0-120%)
      - 90%+: Excellent performance
      - 70-89%: Good performance 
      - <70%: May need tuning

      **Temperature Accuracy**: How close temperatures stay to target
      - 85%+: Very accurate (±1°C typically)
      - 70-84%: Acceptable accuracy
      - <70%: Poor accuracy - check sensors and thresholds

      **Control Stability**: Measures control smoothness
      - 90%+: Stable, few adjustments needed
      - 70-89%: Moderately stable
      - <70%: Unstable - frequent valve adjustments

      **Actions per Hour**: Number of control decisions per hour
      - 1-4: Ideal range
      - 5-10: Acceptable but watch stability
      - 10+: Too frequent - may indicate issues
